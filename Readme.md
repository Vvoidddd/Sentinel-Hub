# Sentinel Hub Loader

**Sentinel Hub** is a powerful loader script for Roblox, designed to seamlessly load game-specific hubs, including the **Universal Hub**, **Slime Slaying Online RPG (SSO) Hub**, and **Bubble Gum Simulator INFINITY Hub**. The script automatically detects the game you're playing and loads the appropriate hub. More hubs will be added as development continues.

## üéÆ Supported Games
- **Slime Slaying Online RPG** *(Game ID: 15230308693)*
    - The loader will automatically load the **Slime Slaying Online RPG Hub** when you join the game.

- **Bubble Gum Simulator INFINITY** *(Game ID: 85896571713843)*
    - The loader will automatically load the **Bubble Gum Simulator INFINITY Hub** when you join the game.

## üõ† How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Your Script Executor
To use Sentinel Hub, you need a Roblox script executor that supports `loadstring()`. Some popular options include:
- [Krnl](https://krnl.place)
- [Synapse X](https://www.synapse.to)
- [ScriptWare](https://www.scriptware.app)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Attach the Executor to Roblox
- Launch Roblox and join a game.
- Attach your script executor to the Roblox client.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Copy the Loadstring
Get the latest loadstring from below!

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vvoidddd/Sentinel-Hub/refs/heads/main/Release/Loader.lua"))()
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Execute the Loadstring
- Paste the copied script into your executor.
- Execute it.
- The loader will detect the game you're in and load the correct hub:
  - If you're in **Slime Slaying Online RPG**, it will load the **SSO Hub**.
  - If you're in **Bubble Gum Simulator INFINITY**, it will load the **BGSI Hub**.
  - For unsupported games, the **Universal Hub** will load.

## üöÄ Future Expansions
As Sentinel Hub grows, more game-specific hubs will be developed, bringing new features and optimizations tailored to different Roblox games.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
- The loader **will not work** in restricted or blacklisted games.
- If you attempt to use it in a restricted game, you will be automatically kicked.
